        <P>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the backbone of the World Wide Web. 
            It is a markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. With HTML, web developers can define the structure, content, and layout of a webpage, enabling seamless navigation and interaction.
            HTML utilizes a system of tags to mark up elements within a document. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets and provide 
            instructions to web browsers on how to display the content. By using tags, developers can create headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and much more.
            One of the greatest strengths of HTML is its simplicity. It is easy to 
            learn and understand, making it accessible to beginners. With a basic understanding of HTML, one can create a functional webpage in no time.
            HTML also plays a crucial role in website accessibility and search engine optimization. 
            Properly structured HTML improves the accessibility of a website, ensuring that it can be used by people with disabilities. Additionally, search engines 
            rely on HTML to understand the content and structure of a webpage, which influences its visibility in search results.
            
             been developed to simplify and enhance the process of building web pages with HTML. These tools provide pre-designed components, responsive layouts, and interactive features that can be easily integrated into HTML code.</P>
        <h2 id="section-css">CSS</h2>
        <P>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology in web development that allows developers to control the appearance and layout of HTML documents. It provides a powerful set of tools and properties to design visually appealing and user-friendly websites. With CSS, developers can define how elements should be displayed, positioned, sized, and styled on a web page.
            One of the features of CSS is its ability to separate the content of a web page from its presentation. This separation enhances the maintainability and flexibility of web projects by enabling developers to make changes to the design without modifying the underlying HTML structure. By creating reusable stylesheets, developers can apply consistent styling across multiple pages, which leads to efficient development and easier maintenance.
            CSS offers a wide range of selectors that allow developers to target specific elements or 
            groups of elements to apply styling rules selectively. Selectors can be based on element types, classes, IDs, attributes, or even the relationship between elements. This flexibility enables fine-grained control over the styling of individual elements.
            Inion to basic properties like colors, fonts, and margins, CSS provides advanced features such 
            as transitions, animations, and media queries. Transitions and animations enable smooth and interactive effects, while media queries allow for responsive design, adapting the layout and styling of a webpage to different screen sizes and devices.
            Overall CSS plays a crucial role in shaping the visual presentation of web pages, 
            enabling developers to create engaging, accessible, and responsive websites. 
            Its versatility and widespread support across browsers make it an essential tool for modern 
            web development. CSS Selectors: CSS selectors are patterns used to select and target specific HTML elements for styling. There are various types of selectors available in CSS, such as element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements. This wide range of selectors provides developers with precise control over styling elements</P>
